# Contributing to RSG
The team welcomes feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community.  If you would like to get involved, and help support this project, please read the information below on reporting issues and submitting code fixes.

## Reporting Issues or Feature Requests
The team makes every effort to ensure that all the features released are working as expected using both unit tests and sample applications.  However, it is impossible for the team to test every scenario or use case, so we expect that users will find issues at some point.

If you find a new issue, please create an issue in GitHub.  You can find information on creating an issue [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).  When creating an issue, please ensure that it contains the following information:
 1. Mark the issue with the *bug* label
 2. The output/result you received
 3. The expected output/result
 4. A sample of code that can be used to reproduce the issue
 5. (Optional) Suggestion of how to fix the code

Including the above information will help the team review the issue faster and determine if it is indeed an issue, its priority, and work on fixing the issue.

If you would like to make a Feature Request, you can also use the GitHub issues page.  Please make sure you add the *enhancement* label so that the team can separate these requests out from the bug requests.  Any feature requests should include the following information:

 1. Mark the request with the *enhancement* label
 2. Information on what feature you would like to see
 3. Provide details on a sample situtation where this feature would be used and why it can't ccurrently be accomplished
 4. (Optional) A sample of code, or pseudo-code, of how the feature would be used
 5. (Optional) If the code required to implement the feature is small, you can provide a sample of the code/pseudo-code.

After an issue, or feature request, is submitted, a member of the RSG team will review the submission.  If the submission is considered valid, and there is enough information to implement it, the submission will be marked with an *approved* label.  Users should not submit pull requests for any item unless it has been marked with the *approved* label.

## Contributing Guidelines
The following are some guidelines for contributing to this project:
- **DO** create one pull request per issue and ensure that the [issue is linked](https://github.blog/2011-10-12-introducing-issue-mentions/) in the pull request.
- **DO** include a good description of the pull request.  This should include information such as *why* the change is being made, *why* you implemented in the way you did, manual tsting that was performed to validate the change, etc.  The more details the better.
- **DO** include unit tests and samples whenever possible.
- **DO NOT** submit a pull requests unless it is linked to an issue marked with the ```approved``` label.
- **DO NOT** merge multiple changes into one pull request unless they have the same root cause.
- **DO NOT** submit changes that only include formatting changes and/or typographical fixes if no code has been otherwise modified.

***All unit tests MUST be passing before submitting a pull request***

## Review Process
After a pull request is submitted, a member of the team will review the code.  Any community member may participate in the review, and provide feedback, 
but a member of the team will ultimately approve the request.
